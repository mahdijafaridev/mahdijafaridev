# Backend + AI Engineer | Python, FastAPI, LLMs, RAG & Agents | micro1.ai Certified

I'm a backend+AI Engineer with 6+ years of experience building and scaling backend systems. I mainly work with Python and FastAPI, and in recent years, I've been focused on integrating AI into backend workflows — especially LLMs, RAG, and agent-based systems.

I care about writing clean, maintainable code while delivering fast and solving real problems with practical solutions — no overengineering. Most of my work revolves around:

- Designing scalable backend systems and APIs

- Building LLM agents and RAG pipelines

- Using Docker, CI/CD, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) for smooth DevOps workflows

I'm always learning and exploring better ways to build with AI. I enjoy connecting with engineers, researchers, and product folks who are working at the intersection of backend and GenAI.
