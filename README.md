# Backend Engineer | Python ‚Ä¢ FastAPI ‚Ä¢ LLMs ‚Ä¢ GenAI

Backend engineer with 6+ years of experience building backend systems, APIs, and AI-powered tools.  
I focus on solving the right problems, writing maintainable code, and making technical decisions that balance speed and long-term stability.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend development and GenAI ‚Äî powering real products with LLMs, agents, and data pipelines.

### What I Work On
- Scalable backend systems using Python and FastAPI
- LLM-powered tools and agents (LangChain, RAG, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Infrastructure and CI/CD workflows (Docker, GitHub Actions, GCP, AWS)
- System design, API architecture, and engineering team support
